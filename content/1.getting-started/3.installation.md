## Local development

::steps
### Install Package
Use the `composer` CLI command to install Laravel Zap in a Laravel application:
```bash [Terminal]
composer require laraveljutsu/zap
```

### Setup Database
Publish and run the migrations to set up the required database tables:
```bash [Terminal]
# Publish and run migrations
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zap-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

::warning
Before installing and preparing your models, ensure that `schedules` and `schedule_periods` tables, as well as `Schedule` and `SchedulePeriod` models, do not already exist in your project to avoid conflicts.
::

### Publish Configuration (Optional)
If you need to customize the package configuration, publish the config file:
```bash [Terminal]
# Publish configuration file
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zap-config
```

### Add Trait to Models
Add the `HasSchedules` trait to any model that should support scheduling:
```php [User.php]
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Zap\Models\Concerns\HasSchedules;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasSchedules;
}
```
::

## Quick Start Example

Once installed, you can immediately start creating schedules using Laravel Zap's fluent API:

### Basic Schedule
```php [Example]
use Zap\Facades\Zap;

// Create a simple appointment
$schedule = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Doctor Appointment')
    ->description('Annual checkup')
    ->on('2025-03-15') // on() is an alias of from()
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '10:00')
    ->save();
```

### Recurring Schedule
```php [Example]
// Weekly team meeting
$meeting = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Team Standup')
    ->from('2025-01-01')
    ->to('2025-12-31')
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '09:30')
    ->weekly(['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday'])
    ->save();
```

### Check Availability
```php [Example]
// Check if user is available
$available = $user->isAvailableAt('2025-03-15', '14:00', '16:00');

if ($available) {
    // User is free, proceed with booking
    echo "User is available!";
}
```

### Getting Started with Documentation
Once the installation is complete, you can start using Laravel Zap's scheduling features in your application. The package provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing schedules and recurring events.
