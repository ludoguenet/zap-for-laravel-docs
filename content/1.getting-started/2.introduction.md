Welcome to **Laravel Zap**, a flexible, performant, and developer-friendly **schedule management system** built for [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

## What is Laravel Zap?

Laravel Zap is the **missing schedule management system** for Laravel applications.
It provides a **powerful scheduling engine** with deep Laravel integration, giving developers tools to handle **availability, appointments, recurring events, and business rules** — all while staying fully Eloquent-friendly.

Whether you’re building a **booking system, resource planner, or calendar application**, Laravel Zap gives you everything you need to manage complex schedules with ease.

We use Laravel Zap across internal projects at [Laravel Jutsu](https://github.com/ludoguenet), and it is designed to scale from **small apps to enterprise-grade scheduling systems**.
